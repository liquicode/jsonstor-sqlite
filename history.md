# Project History


v0.2.0 (current)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Built on `@liquicode/jsonstor` 0.2.0 and `@liquicode/jsongin` 0.2.0. A criteria the engine
  refuses is refused before the storage acts on it.
- `FindMany2()` takes a `Paging` object, `{ SkipCount, MaxCount }`, as well as a number.
- `StorageInfo()` reports the adapter asked for, the dialect in force and the server version.
- The `PrimaryKey` setting names the identifier field. It is unique, and an update which
  changes it is refused unless `PrimaryKeyMutable` is `true`.
- A `null` criteria matches every row, and `InsertMany` refuses a value which is not an array.
  *Was: a `null` criteria matched nothing.*
- Declares Node.js `>=22.0.0` in `engines`.


v0.1.0 (2026-08-31)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Initial release.
